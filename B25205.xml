            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Can assure your Lordships, that you are infinitely admir'd for the Fervent Zeal and Constancy, you have all ways had for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is the Best Church in the World, and the Most Apostolick; and tho' She has many Opposers, yet I doubt not but God of his Infinite Goodness, will make Her more than a Conqueror by your Assistance: For was it ever known that any Nobility stuck so firm to their Religion, so that I may compare you to a Rock that is not to be moved. For there is not any thing more Glorious to the Church than Self Denial, and for that I hope your Lordships will be Eternally Famous; for a great many of you has been ready to Sacrifice your Lives and Fortunes, and I doubt not but most of you if need had required, would have been of the same Mind. And I do not doubt, but your Pious Examples will strengthen the whole Nation, if that you do but Crown all your Actions with Loyalty; for if you do but retain that to the End, great will be your Reward, not only Here but in Eternity. My Lords, I must needs say, That you have been very kind to my Soveraign Lord the King, and if his Majesty has not been so kind as he should, you know the Occasion, and considering the Temptations his Majesty had daily on every side, I admir'd that his Majesty Acted so well; for I am very sensible that he withstood many Temptations sore against the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> Will; for which Clemency and Goodness, he is highly condemned by them; which I hope you will take into your seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Consideration; for I know you are such Noble Souls as hates Ingratitude, or rendering evil for evil. For I know it is in your Power to make your selves happy, if you will use all Pious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to do the King Good and to Reclaim him by Fine and Gentle Means, and not to suffer <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesuits</hi> nor any <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to come about him: But this must not be done in a hurry as if you did not care for your King and was so indifferent as if you could be as well without him as with him; but you must pass by all Injuries and love him, that you may Pitty and Pray for him, and I doubt not, but that God that changed <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi>'s Heart, will change his, and make him Glorious and you all Happy, therefore fear not, but put your trust in God, and all things shall do well; for I can assure you, if the King Falls, his Fall will be our Ruin. And as for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> I have a high Esteem for him, forasmuch as he pretends ro Vindicate the Church of <hi>England</hi> and to Prevent <hi>Popery;</hi> and if he really doth this and has no By-ends, I'll say he will be a Glorious Prince: But if he has any By-ends to lessen the King and promote Himself, his End will be miserable; for if his Highness doth design Good for the King, why should he forbid the Oath of Supremacy; but I hope no Good Soul will yield to that; for he is our Supream, and we will allways own him: For ther's not any weary of the King, but only desires to be Free'd from <hi>Popery:</hi> If his Highness don't do that, he had better have stay'd in his own Countrey.</p>
            <p>And So the Almighty Bless, Guide and Direct You, in all Your Councils, that You may be Present and Eternally Happy: is the Prayer of</p>
